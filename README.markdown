UseBB 1 resources
=================

This repository contains the resources for UseBB 1 that have been contributed over the years. This includes:

* ACP modules
* convertors
* modifications (mods)
* templates
* translations

All of the resources are unofficial and thus unsupported -- that's why they are outside of the UseBB 1 source tree. Please use them at your responsibility and eventually ask for help in our [Resources forum](http://www.usebb.net/community/forum-10.html).

If you wish to contribute, please feel free to fork the code or send your additions to *contact at usebb.net*.

Deprecated stuff
----------------

Please be advised UseBB 1 has its age and has had several beta 0.x releases in 2004-2006. Some resources might now work anymore, while others might be untested or outdated.

Since UseBB 1 will be replaced with version 2, consider building future resources for UseBB 2 instead.
