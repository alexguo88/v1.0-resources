modinstall
==========

An installer for UseBB 0.2.

**Note:** this mod was made for UseBB 0.2. Today, it is not only unusable but redundant as well, leaving nothing more than a curiosity.

Original description:

<pre>
This Installation wizard is fully language independant,
and automates the whole installation process of UseBB
from database set up to basic board config. It is also
freely available, released under GPL. Some of the features:

*Automated UseBB Setup
- Automatic Database Creation or Manual (using an
existing database).

*Step by step installation of UseBB.
- Requires no technical knowledge.
- Automatically writes and chmod's config.php.

*Multi-lingual
- Support for multiple languages.
- Packed with english as default.

*Secure
- Install locks after the wizard completes. No threat
of malicious installs.

Requirements:

- PHP 4 or Greater
- MySQL
- Optionally an existing database.
- Browser ;)

Notes

The automatic database creation feature requires that
your MySQL account has sufficient permissions. Ask your
admin if you have these permissions, and if not, just
use an existing database via the manual database
option. This feature is also still in beta stages, so I
can't guarantee that it will work for you.

modInstall has gone through testing, and everything
save the Auto DB Creation appears fine. Bugs may still
exist however, so report any you find in the modInstall
thread on the UseBB Community Forums, or email me at
jwehner AT wehnerweb.com.
