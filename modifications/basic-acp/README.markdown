basic-acp
=========

A simple control panel for managing various content types in UseBB 0.x. It was developed at the time the ACP was not yet fully completed.

**Note:** this mod was made for UseBB 0.x. Today, it is (probably) not only unusable but redundant as well, leaving nothing more than a curiosity.
