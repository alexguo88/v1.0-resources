karma
=====

Karma is a kind of popularity thing. It's purely for fun, and it offers no kind of functionality/limitations.

The idea behind karma is that people can smite or applaud a user, affecting their karma by +1 or -1. This results in users having a kind of score, which reflects what people on the board think of them.

**Note:** this mod was made for UseBB 0.x. Today, it is (probably) not only unusable but redundant as well, leaving nothing more than a curiosity.
